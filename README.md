Note: This repository is in maintenance mode. This means we focus on keeping the project alive by not allowing major overhauls of any system or any major features. Fixing bugs, updating sources and ensuring that code interacting with external resources still function will be our main goal.
# How to Install/Modify
It should be pretty explanatory if you have basic knowledge of html, js, and css. In any case, you can edit the index.html file to your liking by replacing the icons and social links, positioning them wherever you want, etc.
Add more pages, scripts, and custom css shouldn't create any conflicts, just keep track of the file names that the original index.html references.
Then, you can host all these files on a web server.
Other than that, enjoy!
